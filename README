The SPIRRID package is the part of the project SIMVISAGE 
(http://mordred.imb.rwth-aachen.de/projects/simvisage/wiki).

== Core ==

This package is the main and contains tools for RV sampling, code generation and
numerical multidimensional statistical integration.

== Pdistrib (library of statistical distributions) ==

The package provides a traited wrapper for the scipy distributions.

== Examples ==

The directories "fiber_*" provides the performance studies of the spirrid
integration tool. There are three types of response functions
tested:

The implementation of the generic integration algorithm
is given in mu_integ.py

 * fiber_tt_2p.py: fiber tensile test with 2 parameters 
   one strong discontinuity) 
 * fiber_tt_5p.py: fiber tensile test with 5 parameters
   one strong and one weak discontinuity
 * fiber_po_8p.py: fiber pullout test with 7 parameters
   one strong, one weak discontinuity 
   and nonlinear range within the response

Folder masked_arrays contains test dealing with using of numpy.ma.array to speeding up
evaluation of numpy vectorized functions.

Folder numexpr contains test dealing with using of numexpr to speeding up
evaluation of numpy vectorized functions.


== Util ==

This folder contains customized (extended) source code (enthought, scipy).
